## team-profile-generator

# Summary

For this assignment I had to create a team profile generator. I used inquirer module and the fs module to build a command line application that took in user inputs from questions and dynamically creates html card images with the help from bootstrap and fontawsome.  I created 1 parent class and three children classes as requested to help utilize the OOP concepts we learned in class.  I was able to call these functions within my HTML to help populate the website with the user input.
